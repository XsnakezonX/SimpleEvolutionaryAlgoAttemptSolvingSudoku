Read me for the EA for the sudoku.py script

Python version: 3.10
Python numpy module

How to run the python script:

- open with any IDE or simply run with a terminal

Configuration:

There are 3 grids available to choose from.
Change the variable 'grid' on line 80 to one of the following: 
- 'grid1'
- 'grid2'
- 'grid3'

There are 4 population size available to choose from.
Uncomment only one out of four available size on between line 117-120

For example:

POPULATION_SIZE = 10
# POPULATION_SIZE = 100
# POPULATION_SIZE = 1000
# POPULATION_SIZE = 10000

P.S. Repeat running the program to see the performance different for the same and different settings.
